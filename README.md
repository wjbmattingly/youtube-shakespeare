# YouTube Shakespeare Semantic Search Application 

This [repository](https://github.com/wjbmattingly/youtube-shakespeare) contains the source code for a Streamlit application that leverages the powerful capabilities of TxtAI for semantic search across the entire Shakespeare corpus. The live application can be accessed at [here](https://streamlit.as.uky.edu/semantic-shakespeare/).

## About The Project

This application brings the power of machine learning to the works of Shakespeare, allowing users to perform semantic search across all of his plays and poems. This provides users a unique opportunity to explore Shakespeare's works in an innovative way.

## Features

1. **Semantic Search**: Search not just by keywords, but by the meaning of your query, giving you more relevant results.

2. **Full Corpus Access**: The application covers the entirety of Shakespeare's works.

3. **Powered by TxtAI**: Utilizing TxtAI for natural language processing and understanding, the tool provides a robust and fast way to explore the texts.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.7 or later
* Streamlit 1.0.0 or later
* TxtAI 4.0.0 or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/wjbmattingly/youtube-shakespeare.git
```

2. Install the requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Streamlit app

```
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage

Simply enter your search term into the application. The algorithm will return passages from Shakespeare's works that are semantically related to your search. This isn't a simple keyword search - it uses artificial intelligence to understand the meaning of your query and find related content.
